			<h1>Oh, hello!</h1>
			<h2>My name is Peggy and this is a sm√• personal site.</h2>
			<p>
				I'm a Frontend Developer who is studying to go full stack through Flatiron School's Software Engineering course. It begins in just two weeks. Today is the 12th of January, 2024. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Wish me luck! We wrap up the 10th of May.

			<h3>Ok, cool. Now what?</h3>
			<p>
				Well, not a whole lot lives here, however, if you're curious about my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peggywang/" target="_blank">professional experience</a>, you're welcome to have a look. Perhaps we might collaborate on something together? If you're curious about how I'm progressing as a developer, my <a href="https://github.com/pwangy" target="_blank">github</a> repos might give you an idea of what I'm working on. Wondering what's on in my headphones? I'm still scrobbling over at <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/hellodanger" target="_blank">last.fm</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, <a href="https://blipsandclicks.com/" target="_blank">blipsandclicks</a> is a dusty website that could do with a serious update. It has been my digital web thing for as long as anyone can remember.

			<h3>No, I do not have a webring for you to join. Sorry! (please stop asking)</h3>
