- [x] Add, commit and push the new content to the remote
- [x] Enable GitHub Pages in the remote repository's settings
- [x] Check out the published site
- [ ] Continue building out the HTML and add CSS and JavaScript files
- [ ] Create a personal website

## Requirements

This project is an opportunity to showcase what you've learned so far, so it is important that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are incorporated into the project in some way. For example, you could use a `mouseover` event to change the appearance of an element when the user mouses over it. Or use a `click` event to toggle some content between being visible and hidden. There are a variety of ways to do this using the CSS and JavaScript you've learned so far, but don't forget you can always use Google if you get stuck. Google is an invaluable tool for developers! Try to use this project as an opportunity to stretch your coding skills!

The content, styling, and functionality of your site are up to you. Keep in mind that you may show this project to your peers and future instructors, so be considerate of content/subject matter and your potential audience.

## Getting Started and a Recommended Workflow

With all of this in place, you are ready to start working on the _content_,_styles_, and _behavior_ you want your site to have. Because your site is published on GitHub Pages, you'll be able to continuously push updates to your site _as you build it_.

In general, when it comes to building code-related projects, it is often best to establish a routine of making small improvements, checking to make sure those improvements work and don't break things. This routine might look something like the following:

1) Write some HTML, CSS or JavaScript
2) Go to your browser and refresh the page to see the changes
3) Adjust your code and repeat until you're satisfied
4) Move on to the next task and repeat the process

It is very common to get lost in coding and to keep going from one task to the next without checking your work. The problem here is that if you make a mistake it becomes more and more difficult to spot and debug the error.

By frequently checking your work, you'll set your own project milestones — at each one, you can verify everything is working so when you _do_ make a mistake, you'll know it was made recently.

## Professional Git Development Workflow

When it comes to Git, there is ultimately no rule that says you _must_ do things a certain way. However, if there was anything we could impart to you regarding good version control habits, it would be this — commit code frequently.

As mentioned, it is a common habit to dive into the code of a project and write as much as you can, for as long as you can. However, not only does this increase the chance for bugs, it will result in very large Git commits or just _one_ big commit for everything.

Repositories with a good commit history can relay a story about their
development from just the commit messages alone. For example, instead of the
commit history looking like this:

- Commit 1: "Initialize Repository"
- Commit 2: "Finish website"

A good history might look closer to this:

- Commit 1: "Initialize Repository"
- Commit 2: "Add basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript files"
- Commit 3: "Create initial HTML content"
- Commit 4: "Add CSS rules"
- Commit 5: "Fix syntax issue in HTML"
- Commit 6: "Finish bio/about section"
- Commit 7: "Add JS event listeners"
- etc...
- Commit 22: "Adjust styling for new HTML layout"
- Commit 23: "Finish website"

The commit messages here suggest that each commit above addressed a small, often_singular_ task.

## Conclusion

Once you've finished building your website, make sure to push it all up to GitHub. If you followed our advice and set up GitHub Pages first, you've now successfully built _and_ published a website! Fantastic work!
